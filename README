Description
-----------
Do you think Netcat is a really powerful tool?. So I do, but I don't use most of the features of this great tool, and, at the same time I would like to have some other features. That's the reason I wrote Netkitty (nk for friends).

Features and Status
-------------------
The main features of NetKitty are:

    * Can establish several TCP and UDP client connections simultaneously
    * Support of rfcomm Bluetooth connections
    * Can listen to several ports simultaneously
    * Hub mode (Poor's Man IM): Anything coming from any connection is forwarded to any other active connections.
    * Shell mode (Poor's Man telnet): Basic remote shell... really basic
    * Less than 500 LOC
    * Do not depends on any extra library, just system calls
    * Can be compiled into a less than 10K static binary (included in the package)
